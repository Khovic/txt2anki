A. VM, Host, Prism Central
B. VM, Host, Cluster
C. VM, Category, Prism Element
D. VM, Category, Cluster
Answer: B
Question #:2
Which two providers does Calm integrate natively with? (Choose two.)
A. AWS
B. Alibaba
C. AHV
Answer: A C

Explanation
Calm integrates natively with AWS and AHV as providers. A provider is a cloud platform or infrastructure
that hosts the application VMs or services. Calm supports various providers such as Nutanix, AWS, Azure,
GCP, VMware, and Kubernetes. AWS and AHV are two of the most commonly used providers in Calm, as
they offer scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency for deploying applications. References: Nutanix Certified
Professional - Multicloud Automation (NCP-MCA) Exam Blueprint Guide, page 11; Nutanix Calm User
Guide, section 3.1.
Question #:3
A developer has a Development Blueprint that performs the following high level items:
Creates a Windows and Ubuntu Server.
Installs IIS on Windows
Installs MySQL on Ubuntu
As part of Development, there is a need for an Operator to restart IIS Services for troubleshooting purposes.
How should the developer add this functionality to the Blueprint?
A. Add an Execute Task in the Restart Action of the Application Profile.
B. Add an Execute Task in the Restart Action of the Windows/IIS Service.
C. Add a Delay Task in the Restart Action of the Windows/IIS Service.
D. Create an Endpoint for the IIS server and a Runbook that restarts the service.
Answer: B

Explanation
The Restart Action of a Service allows the developer to define custom tasks that will be executed when the
service is restarted. An Execute Task can run any script or command on the target VM, such as restarting the
IIS service. This way, the Operator can use the Self-Service Portal to restart the service without logging into
the VM or using another tool.

Question #:7
What is the most optimal way to transfer Playbooks between different Nutanix Cloud Managers (NCM)?
A. NCM Disaster Recovery
B. Export and Import
C. Use Date Lens to migrate.
D. Recreate the Playbook
Answer: B

Explanation
According to the Nutanix Support & Insights1, the most optimal way to transfer Playbooks between different
Nutanix Cloud Managers (NCM) is to use the Export and Import function. This function allows you to save a
copy of your Playbook as a JSON file and then upload it to another NCM instance. This way, you can easily
reuse your Playbooks across different environments without having to recreate them from scratch or use other
methods that may not be compatible or efficient. References: 1: Nutanix Support & Insights, Playbooks

C. Package
D. Substrates
Answer: D

Explanation
Substrates are the components of a blueprint that define the cloud resources and configurations for deploying
VMs or applications. Substrates can be associated with different cloud accounts, such as AWS, Azure, GCP,
or Nutanix, to enable multicloud deployments. By using substrates, an administrator can create a blueprint that
can deploy VMs to multiple clouds, depending on the availability, cost, or performance requirements.

Calm encountered the error shown in the exhibit when importing a script that maps a network drive.
Upon further investigation, the Calm administrator was unable to run the script manually on a VM and
discovered that elevated permissions were needed.
Which command should the administrator add to the script?
A. Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role Server -Force
B. Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role Client
C. Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role Server
D. Disable-WSManCredSSP -Role Server -Force
Answer: B

Explanation
The error message indicates that the script failed to authenticate to the remote server using CredSSP. CredSSP
is a security mechanism that allows a client to delegate its credentials to a remote server for authentication. To
use CredSSP, both the client and the server need to enable it and configure the role and the trusted hosts. The
command Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role Client enables CredSSP on the client side and specifies the remote

Which two configuration items should the administrator check to ensure Calm can communicate with Beam?
(Choose two.)
A. DNS configuration in Prism Central
B. Ensure Pulse is enabled
C. Prism Element is configured with Proxy settings
D. Flow is enabled in the same Prism Central
Answer: A C

Explanation
The alert in Prism Central indicates that Calm showback is not able to reach the beam service. This could be
due to network connectivity issues or incorrect configurations. The administrator should check the DNS
configuration in Prism Central (Option A) to ensure that it is correctly configured to allow communication
with the Beam service. Additionally, checking if Prism Element is configured with Proxy settings (Option C)
is essential as it can also affect the communication between Calm and Beam. Pulse (Option B) and Flow

Question #:11
A developer updated a blueprint to ensure that the IP address of the VM is reserved in IPAM as part of the
deployment process. The developer noticed that when new VMs are created, they still get a DHCP IP address
and not a reserved IP address.
What is the most likely reason for this behavior?
A. Developer created a pre-create task for reserving the IP address
B. Developer created a post-create task for reserving the IP address
C. Developer forgot to save the updated blueprint
D. Developer forgot to publish the updated blueprint
Answer: B

Explanation

Pass Your Certification With Marks4sure Guarantee

Practice Test

Nutanix - NCP-MCA

The most likely reason for this behavior is that the developer created a post-create task for reserving the IP
address. A post-create task is executed after the VM is created and powered on, which means that the VM
already obtained a DHCP IP address before the task is run. To reserve the IP address in IPAM as part of the
deployment process, the developer should create a pre-create task instead. A pre-create task is executed before
the VM is created and powered on, which allows the task to reserve the IP address in IPAM and assign it to the
VM. References: Nutanix Certified Professional - Multicloud Automation (NCP-MCA) Exam Blueprint
Guide, page 15; Nutanix NCP-MCA Questions, question 57.
Question #:12
An administrator is notified of changes made to VMs on an AHV cluster and wants to verify the changes
inside of a Calm application.
Where should the administrator check for synchronized changes between Prism Central and Calm?
A. On the Prism Central Tasks page
B. On the Audit tab of the Calm application
C. On the Environments tab of the Calm project
D. On the Overview tab of the Calm application
Answer: B

Explanation
The Audit tab of the Calm application shows the history of actions performed on the application, such as
create, update, delete, launch, stop, etc. It also shows the status of the synchronization between Prism Central
and Calm, which indicates if the changes made to the VMs on the AHV cluster are reflected in the Calm
application. The administrator can check the Audit tab to verify the changes and troubleshoot any issues with
the synchronization. References:

C. Choose Skip task and let the Blueprint continue.
D. Choose Retry task and let the Blueprint continue.
Answer: D

Explanation
When a task fails in a Multi VM Blueprint deployment within Nutanix Calm due to an issue such as a
typographical error, and the error has been corrected, the administrator has options to handle the situation
without needing to start the entire process from scratch.
According to Nutanix Calm documentation, the appropriate action after fixing the error is to choose the "Retry
task" option. This allows the deployment process to continue from the point of failure, saving time and
resources as opposed to deleting and relaunching the entire application or moving the blueprint to another
project.

Practice Test

Nutanix - NCP-MCA

An administrator has a Linux VM that does batch processing out of a queue. Currently, a technician connects
to the VM console and runs a command on the VM to initiate or terminate the batch processing application, as
there is no programmatic interface for the application.
The application is processor intensive, so it should only run outside of business hours. The VM has the ability
to send REST API calls to Prism.
How should the administrator configure a Playbook to satisfy the needs of this process with minimal external
interaction?
A. Manual Trigger > Power On > VM SSH > Wait for Some Time > Power Off VM
B. Time Trigger > VM SSH > Wait for Some Time > VM SSH
C. Webhook Trigger > REST API > Wait for Some Time > REST API
D. Manual Trigger > VM SSH > Wait for Some Time > VM SSH
Answer: B

Explanation
A Playbook is a collection of tasks that can be executed based on a trigger, such as a time, a webhook, or a
manual action. A Playbook can be used to automate workflows across different systems and services, such as
Nutanix Prism, VMs, hosts, and external APIs. A Playbook can also use variables, conditions, and loops to
customize the execution logic and data.
In this scenario, the administrator wants to automate the batch processing application on the Linux VM, which
can only be controlled by a command on the VM console. The application should run only outside of business
hours, and the VM should send REST API calls to Prism to report its status.
The best way to configure a Playbook for this process is to use a Time Trigger, which allows the administrator
to specify a schedule for the Playbook execution, such as daily, weekly, or monthly. The Time Trigger can
also be configured to run only on certain days or hours, such as weekdays or nights. This way, the
administrator can ensure that the Playbook runs only outside of business hours, without requiring any manual
intervention.
The Playbook should then have two VM SSH tasks, one to initiate the batch processing application, and one to
terminate it. A VM SSH task is a task that executes a command or script on a target VM using SSH. A VM
SSH task can be used to control applications or services that do not have a programmatic interface, such as the
batch processing application in this scenario. The VM SSH task can also use variables to pass data to or from
the command or script, such as the VM name, IP address, or output.
The Playbook should also have a Wait for Some Time task, which is a task that pauses the Playbook execution
for a specified duration or until a condition is met. A Wait for Some Time task can be used to ensure that the
batch processing application has enough time to complete its work, or to wait for a certain event or state to
occur, such as a file creation, a service status, or a VM power state.
The Playbook should also have two REST API tasks, one before and one after the Wait for Some Time task. A
REST API task is a task that executes an HTTP request to a specified URL, with optional headers, body, and
authentication. A REST API task can be used to interact with external systems or services that expose an API,

Practice Test

Nutanix - NCP-MCA

such as Nutanix Prism in this scenario. The REST API task can also use variables to pass data to or from the
HTTP request, such as the VM name, IP address, or response.
The REST API tasks should be configured to send the VM status to Prism, such as the start and end time of
the batch processing, the CPU and memory usage, or the output of the application. This way, the administrator
can monitor and manage the VM and the application from Prism, without having to connect to the VM
console.
The Playbook configuration should look something like this:
Time Trigger: Set the schedule to run daily, only on weekdays, and only at night (e.g., 10 PM to 6 AM).
VM SSH: Set the target VM to the Linux VM, and set the command or script to initiate the batch
processing application (e.g., ./batch.sh start).
REST API: Set the URL to the Prism API endpoint, and set the HTTP method, headers, body, and
authentication as required. Use variables to pass the VM name, IP address, and start time of the batch
processing to the HTTP request (e.g., {"vm_name": "{{vm_name}}", "vm_ip": "{{vm_ip}}",
"start_time": "{{start_time}}"}).
Wait for Some Time: Set the duration to the expected time for the batch processing to finish, or set a
condition to wait until a certain event or state occurs (e.g., wait until file /tmp/batch.done exists).
REST API: Set the URL to the Prism API endpoint, and set the HTTP method, headers, body, and
authentication as required. Use variables to pass the VM name, IP address, end time, and output of the
batch processing to the HTTP request (e.g., {"vm_name": "{{vm_name}}", "vm_ip": "{{vm_ip}}",
"end_time": "{{end_time}}", "output": "{{output}}"}).
VM SSH: Set the target VM to the Linux VM, and set the command or script to terminate the batch
processing application (e.g., ./batch.sh stop).

Question #:17
An administrator had provided Linux VM console access to the OS Team. However, the team is unable to
access one of the newly-created Linux VMs.
How can the administrator resolve this issue?
A. Create a local user in Linux OS and provide access to the OS Team.
B. Provide Prism Admin access to the OS Team Active Directory Group.
C. Create a role for the OS Team Active Directory Group and add the VMs to it.
D. Assign new VMs to a category and provide category access to the OS Team.
Answer: D

Explanation
Categories are a way of organizing and managing resources in Nutanix Calm. Categories can be used to define
access policies, filter resources, and group applications. By assigning new VMs to a category, the
administrator can grant access to the OS Team based on their Active Directory Group membership. The OS
Team can then use the web SSH console to access the Linux VMs from the Calm UI.

The best way to automate the entire database and application deployments is to use a combination of Nutanix
Calm and Nutanix Era. Nutanix Calm is a multicloud automation platform that allows you to create blueprints
to deploy and manage infrastructure and applications across different cloud environments. Nutanix Era is a
database management platform that allows you to provision, clone, patch, refresh, and restore databases in a
simplified and automated way. By creating a Calm blueprint that deploys applications and calls Era APIs to
automate database deployments, you can achieve faster and consistent releases, as well as reduce the manual
effort and complexity involved in the process. You can also leverage the features of Calm and Era, such as
self-service, governance, showback, backup, and recovery, to enhance the efficiency and security of your
deployments. References:

What is the correct syntax for using a macro within a Calm blueprint?
A. @@{calm.object}(@@
B. %calm.object%
C. {{calm.object}}
D. $_calm.object_$
Answer: A

Explanation
A macro is a placeholder for a value that is resolved at runtime. Macros can be used to reference various Calm
objects, such as variables, secrets, credentials, tasks, and services. The correct syntax for using a macro within
a Calm blueprint is @@{calm.object}(@@, where calm.object is the name of the object to be referenced. For
example, @@{username}(@@ would resolve to the value of the username variable at runtime. The other
options are incorrect syntaxes for macros and would not be resolved by Calm. References: Nutanix Certified

Question #:23
An application deployment failed, and a correction was implemented.
What is the most optimal way to correct the failed deployment?
A. Redeploy the application.
B. Create a Run book to retry.
C. Rewrite blueprint to have error handling.
D. Retry the failed deployment
Answer: D

Explanation
The most optimal way to correct the failed deployment is to retry the failed deployment. This option allows the
administrator to resume the deployment from the point of failure, without having to redeploy the entire
application or create a new runbook. Retrying the failed deployment also preserves the application state and
configuration, and avoids creating duplicate resources or conflicts.
Redeploying the application is not the best option, because it requires the administrator to delete the existing
application and launch a new one from scratch. This option wastes time and resources, and may result in data
loss or inconsistency.
Creating a runbook to retry is also not the best option, because it requires the administrator to write a custom
script or workflow to handle the retry logic. This option adds complexity and overhead to the automation
process, and may not be compatible with the original blueprint or application.
Rewriting the blueprint to have error handling is a valid option, but it is not the most optimal one. This option
requires the administrator to modify the blueprint code and add logic to handle different types of errors and
exceptions. This option improves the robustness and reliability of the blueprint, but it does not correct the
failed deployment itself. The administrator still has to redeploy the application or retry the failed deployment
after rewriting the blueprint.

Which step is missing in order for the account to be usable in a Self-Service project?
A. Account Verification
B. Prism Central VIP IP
C. Account Credentials
D. Prism Element VIP IP
Answer: A

Explanation
The error message indicates that the project for the blueprint does not have any associated Nutanix account.
This typically means that the new account added in Self-Service (formerly Calm) has not been verified.
Account verification is required to ensure the account is properly configured and has the necessary
permissions to be used within a Self-Service project.

B. In Calm select Application icon > select application name > Services Tab
C. SSH to Prism Central > /home/calm/log/styx.log
D. In Prism Central go to Activities > Audits and get the audits filter by date
Answer: C

Explanation
The styx.log file contains the logs related to blueprint packaging and deployment. It can be accessed by
SSHing to Prism Central and navigating to the /home/calm/log directory. The other options are not relevant for
blueprint package failures, as they show the application status, audit events, or service

Nutanix - NCP-MCA

A. Create a new blueprint
B. Create a new provider
C. Create a new project
D. Create a new service
Answer: B

Explanation
A provider is a configuration that allows Nutanix Calm to interact with a public cloud platform, such as AWS,
Azure, or GCP. A provider contains the credentials, settings, and policies required to deploy and manage VMs
on the public cloud. Before creating a blueprint for a new public cloud environment, the administrator should
create a new provider for AWS and specify the region, access key, secret key, and other parameters. This will
enable the administrator to select the AWS provider as the deployment location for the blueprint and configure
the VM attributes accordingly. References: Nutanix Multicloud Automation Administration (NMCAA), page
15; Nutanix Certified Professional - Multicloud Automation (NCP-MCA), section 2.
Question #:28
When creating a blueprint, which Pre-create and Post-delete tasks are valid?
A. Create, Start, Stop, Delete
B. Execute, Set variable, HTTP, Delay
C. Create, Start, Stop, Soft Delete
D. Execute, Set variable, API, Delay
Answer: B

Explanation
Pre-create and Post-delete tasks are actions that can be performed before creating or after deleting a blueprint
deployment. They can be used to integrate with external systems, set variables, or add delays. The valid tasks
are Execute, Set variable, HTTP, and Delay. Create, Start, Stop, and Delete are not valid tasks, as they are part
of the deployment lifecycle, not the pre-create or post-delete actions. References: Nutanix Certified

Nutanix - NCP-MCA

To trigger a series of actions (taking a snapshot, expanding the vDisk, and sending a Slack message) from a
pipeline CI/CD, the appropriate trigger to use is "Webhook." Webhooks allow external systems, such as
CI/CD pipelines, to trigger playbooks in Nutanix Calm via HTTP requests, making them suitable for
integrating with CI/CD tools.

Question #:34
During the deployment of a multi-step Blueprint, a failure is encountered. The administrator corrected the
failed step and saved the Blueprint.
What should the administrator do next?
A. Delete the failed application and Launch a new application.
B. Soft Delete the failed application and Launch a new application.
C. Use Continue in the failed application to retry.
D. Upon clicking Save the Blueprint task will be retried automatically.
Answer: D

Explanation
If a Blueprint deployment fails, the administrator can use the Continue option in the Self-Service Portal to
resume the deployment from the point of failure. This option will retry the failed task and continue with the
remaining tasks in the Blueprint. The administrator does not need to delete the application or launch a new
one, as this would waste time and resources. Saving the Blueprint will not automatically retry the task, as the
Blueprint is only a template for the deployment.

Practice Test

Nutanix - NCP-MCA

B. Pre-create
C. Guest Customization
D. Create
Answer: B

Explanation
When integrating with an IP Address Management (IPAM) solution within Nutanix Calm, an administrator
would use a 'Pre-create' task to request a static IP address. This task is performed before the actual creation of
the VM, ensuring that the IP address is allocated and can be assigned during the VM's creation process.
Profiles (A) are used to define deployment environments, Guest Customization (C) is used for configuring the
OS settings, and Create (D) is typically the task for provisioning the actual VM, not for requesting an IP.

Question #:38
An administrator notices a Blueprint fails with the following error for Windows machines:
script execution has failed with error Process creation failed with error:1314
What is causing this issue?
A. The firewall ports 5985 and 5986 are blocked.
B. The Service is running with incorrect privileges to create a process.
C. The credentials provided in the Calm Blueprint does not have sufficient privileges.
D. The Windows machine is in hung state.
Answer: C

Explanation
The error code 1314 indicates that the user does not have the required privilege to perform the requested
operation. This means that the credentials provided in the Calm Blueprint are not valid or do not have enough
permissions to run the script on the Windows machine. To fix this issue, the administrator should verify the
credentials and ensure that they have the appropriate rights to execute the script, such as local administrator or
domain administrator privileges. References: Nutanix Certified Professional - Multicloud Automation

Nutanix - NCP-MCA

An administrator at a busy software development company is looking to roll out Calm for automation and
estimates they will be creating 200 Projects, 500 Runbooks, 1500 Blueprints and automating the deployment
of 7500 VMs for their development teams.
What size of Prism Central VM(s) is recommended to host the Calm environment?
A. 3 nodes Large - 10vCPU and 52GB Memory per node.
B. 1 node Small - 6vCPU and 30GB Memory per node.
C. 3 nodes Small - 6vCPU and 30GB Memory per node.
D. 1 node Large - 10vCPU and 52GB Memory per node.
Answer: A

Explanation
According to the Nutanix Multicloud Automation Administration (NMCAA) course, the recommended Prism
Central VM size depends on the number of VMs that are managed by Calm and the number of concurrent
users. For a large-scale environment with more than 5000 VMs and more than 100 concurrent users, the
recommended size is 3 nodes Large - 10vCPU and 52GB Memory per node1. This size provides enough
resources for the Prism Central cluster to handle the workload and performance requirements of Calm.

Question #:40
An administrator is providing users with access to the company's LOB applications through a VDI solution.
The administrator received information that the company are going to hire 200 new employees who will be
using these applications.
The environment is monitored by a third-party tool that notifies the administrator when the VDI solution is
about to run out of capacity. This gives the administrator time to create additional resources and add them to
the VDI solution.
What should the administrator use when creating a playbook to automate this?
A. A trigger based on a REST API
B.
Pass Your Certification With Marks4sure Guarantee

28 of 141

Practice Test

Nutanix - NCP-MCA

B. A trigger based on an email
C. A trigger based on an event
D. A trigger based on an alert
Answer: C

Explanation
The administrator should use a trigger based on an event when creating a playbook to automate the scaling of
the VDI solution. An event trigger is a type of trigger that executes a playbook when a specific event occurs in
the Nutanix environment or in a third-party system. An event trigger can be configured to listen to events from
various sources, such as Prism alerts, Calm actions, or external webhooks. In this scenario, the administrator
can use an event trigger to listen to the webhook from the third-party monitoring tool and execute a playbook
that creates additional resources and adds them to the VDI solution.
A trigger based on a REST API is not the best option, because it requires the administrator to manually invoke
the playbook using an API call. This is not as efficient or reliable as using an event trigger that automatically
executes the playbook when the capacity threshold is reached.
A trigger based on an email is also not the best option, because it requires the administrator to configure an
email server and a mailbox to receive the notification from the third-party tool. This adds complexity and
overhead to the automation process and may not be as secure or timely as using an event trigger.
A trigger based on an alert is a valid option, but it depends on the availability and compatibility of the Prism
alert system with the third-party tool. If the third-party tool can send alerts to Prism, then the administrator can
use an alert trigger to execute the playbook. However, if the third-party tool does not integrate with Prism,
then the administrator cannot use an alert trigger and has to use an event trigger instead.

Question #:43
An administrator has been tasked with automating the optimization of plays with the autopilot feature.
What must the administrator be aware of before configuring autopilot?
A. Autopilot never waits for approvals.
B. Autopilot feature only applies to metric-based alerts as triggers.
C. Autopilot only applies to new playbooks.
D. Autopilot will only attempt to apply the playbook a single time
Answer: A

Explanation
Autopilot is a feature of Nutanix Calm that allows the administrator to automate the execution of playbooks
based on predefined conditions or triggers. Autopilot can optimize the performance, availability, and cost of
applications by applying the appropriate actions in response to events or metrics. Before configuring autopilot,
the administrator must be aware of the following limitations12:
Autopilot never waits for approvals. This means that the administrator must ensure that the playbooks
are tested and verified before enabling autopilot. Autopilot will execute the playbooks without any
human intervention or confirmation.
Autopilot feature only applies to metric-based alerts as triggers. This means that the administrator can
only use metrics from the Nutanix Prism Central or the Nutanix Karbon clusters as the conditions for
triggering the playbooks. Autopilot does not support other types of triggers such as schedules,
webhooks, or manual triggers. References: Nutanix Certified Professional - Multicloud Automation

A. VM action has a timeout of 5 minutes.
B. puppet action has a timeout of 5 minutes.
C. IP Address SSH action has a timeout of 5 minutes.
D. PowerShell action has a timeout of 5 minutes.
Answer: C

Explanation
The image shows a failed status for an SSH_VM_Task, which is manually triggered. Since the task involves
SSH, it’s likely that the IP Address SSH action has a timeout of 5 minutes, causing the playbook to fail if it
cannot complete within this time frame. The IP Address SSH action is used to execute commands on a remote
VM using SSH. It requires the IP address, username, password, and command to run as inputs. The timeout
parameter specifies how long the action will wait for the command to finish before aborting. If the timeout is
too short, the action may fail due to network latency, slow execution, or other factors. References:

Question #:51
An administrator wants to create a blueprint for a development environment that uses an existing on-premise
GitLab repository. Every new development environment requires a new user in the GitLab repo.
Which two tasks should the administrator perform within a Calm blueprint to automate this process? (Choose
two.)
A. Create an HTTP pre-create task to create the user in GitLab via REST API.
B. Create runtime-editable variables for user and password in the blueprint.
C. Add a task within the service in order to ask for user and password at runtime.
D. Create a task script in order to login with ssh to GitLab and create a random user and password.
Answer: A B

Explanation
To automate the creation of a new user in GitLab for every new development environment, the administrator
should perform the following tasks within a Calm blueprint:
Create an HTTP pre-create task to create the user in GitLab via REST API. This task will send an HTTP
request to the GitLab server with the user information and credentials, and receive a response with the
user ID and status. The administrator can use the response to verify the user creation and store the user
ID as a variable for later use.
Create runtime-editable variables for user and password in the blueprint. These variables will allow the
administrator to specify the user name and password for the new GitLab user at the time of launching
the blueprint. The variables can be passed as parameters to the HTTP pre-create task and used in the
REST API call.
The other two options are not correct because:
Adding a task within the service to ask for user and password at runtime is redundant and
unnecessary, as the runtime-editable variables can already provide this functionality.

Question #:52
An administrator has noticed an increasing number of inactive VMS being left powered on within the
environment over the course of OS migrations, using Playbooks, which two Actions should the administrator
use to start documenting which VMS are marked as inactive to take future Automated actions on? (Choose
two.)
A. Assign the VMS to an Inactive:VM Category as an Action.
B. Trigger Playbook on Powered Off VM for all applicable VMS.
C. Trigger Playbook on Alert with the Inactive VM Alert Policy.
D. Send an Email with the Source Entity Name Parameter in the body.
Answer: A C

Explanation
The administrator should assign the VMs to an Inactive:VM category as an action and trigger a playbook on
alert with the Inactive VM alert policy. By doing this, they can create a custom category to group and identify
the inactive VMs and use a custom alert policy to trigger a playbook that can perform automated actions on
them, such as powering them off, deleting them, or sending notifications. This is based on the general practices
in managing VMs in a multicloud environment, as well as the specific features and requirements of Nutanix

Question #:54
An administrator had provided Linux VM console access to the OS Team. However, the team is unable to
access one of the newly-created Linux VMS within Prism Central.
How can the administrator resolve this issue?
A. Create and assign the Linux OS Category to the newly-created VM,
B. Create and assign the Linux OS Category to the OS Team Active Directory Group,
C. Create a role for the OS Team Active Directory Group and add the VMS to it.
D. Create a local user in Linux OS and provide access to the OS Team.
Answer: A

Explanation
Categories are a way of organizing and managing resources in Nutanix Calm. Categories can be used to define
access policies, filter resources, and group applications. By creating and assigning the Linux OS Category to
the newly-created VM, the administrator can grant access to the OS Team based on their Active Directory
Group membership. The OS Team can then use the web SSH console to access the Linux VM from the Calm
UI.

Practice Test

Nutanix - NCP-MCA

Explanation
Scaling VM replica settings allow you to specify the minimum, maximum, and default number of VMs that
can be created from a blueprint service. The minimum and default values must be equal to or greater than the
number of VMs needed at any time and at time of deployment, which is 2 in this case. The maximum value
must be equal to or less than the project quota divided by the VM resources, which is 100/12 = 8 for vCPUs
and 300/24 = 12 for memory. The lowest of these two values is the limit for the maximum value, which is 8.
Therefore, the only option that meets all the requirements is B. MIN: 2, MAX: 7, Default: 2.

What information does the administrator require to complete this task?
A. Public key of the Calm VM. For the Scale-Out Calm VIVI, provide the public key of all VMs,
B. Private Key of the Calm VX'L For the Scale-Out Calm VMU provide the private key of all VMs.
C. Every Prism Central Virtual IP address to be managed by the policy engine for Calm.
D. Networking information for all devices to be managed by the policy engine for Calm.
Answer: D

Explanation
The policy engine is a single VM setup for the single or scale-out Prism Central. When you enable the policy
engine for your Calm instance, a new VM is created and deployed for the policy engine. All you need is an
available IP address that belongs to the same network as that of your Prism Central VM for the policy engine
VM. You do not need to provide any public or private keys, or any Prism Central virtual IP addresses for this
task. References: Nutanix Support & Insights, Calm on ESXi Deployment | Nutanix Community

C. The user profile does not allow to add tasks.
D. There are no credentials added yet.
Answer: D

Explanation
The options for adding pre-create tasks and installing packages in the VM are grayed out because there are no
credentials added yet. Nutanix Calm requires VM credentials to perform package installations and pre/post
tasks, as these actions need access to the VM to execute the necessary commands and scripts.

Nutanix Calm documentation on Managing VM Credentials.
Nutanix Best Practices for Blueprint Configuration.
Question #:63
After an application is no longer needed, a user puts in a ticket to delete the VM. The administrator finds the
VM in Prism Central and deletes it, but then realize that it was a Self-Service (formerly Calm) managed VM.
When the administrator attempts the application in Self-Service using the Delete action, it fails because the
Substrate cannot be found.
How would the administrator delete the application from management?
A. In the Audit view of the application, click Retry
B. Execute the Soft Delete action to ignore the provide substrate.
C. Execute the Delete action again, the second run will ignore the error.
D. The platform Sync Service will remove the application.
Answer: B

Explanation
When a VM managed by Self-Service (formerly Calm) is deleted manually from Prism Central, the associated
application in Self-Service cannot be deleted using the standard delete action because the substrate is no longer
present. In this scenario, the administrator should use the "Soft Delete" action in Self-Service, which will
remove the application from management without requiring the substrate to be present.

Question #:66
An administrator is tasked with creating a blueprint that can scale an application using Calm.
Which two actions should the administrator take to create and execute a scaling action? (Choose two.)
A. Execute the scaling action in the Manage tab of the application.
B. Execute the scaling action in the Services tab of the application.
C. Create the action under the service profile section of the blueprint.
D. Create the action under the application profile section of the blueprint.
Answer: C D

Explanation
To create and execute a scaling action using Calm, the administrator should create the action under the service
profile section of the blueprint and the application profile section of the blueprint. The service profile section
defines the properties and actions of each service in the blueprint, such as the VM configuration, the scripts to
run, and the scaling parameters. The application profile section defines the properties and actions of the entire
application, such as the number of instances, the dependencies, and the scaling triggers. The administrator can
then execute the scaling action in the Overview tab or the Services tab of the application, depending on the
scope of the scaling action. References:

A. Guest OS customization using sysprep contains <ComputerName>@@{name}@@</ComputerName>.
B. Service VM Name field contains the macro variable @@{calm_array_index}@@.
C. Call an external Python eScript that uses an IPAM API to register the VM name in DNS.
D. Set the VM Name field to allow user edits at launch so the user can enter a custom value at launch.
Answer: B

Explanation
The correct method to result in unique names per VM when scaling out a Service in a Calm Blueprint is to use
the macro variable @@{calm_array_index}@@ in the Service VM Name field (Option B). This variable will
append a unique index number to each VM name based on the scale-out count. For example, if the Service
VM Name is MyAppVM-@@{calm_array_index}@@ and the scale-out count is 3, the resulting VM names
will be MyAppVM-0, MyAppVM-1, and MyAppVM-2. Option A is incorrect because the <ComputerName>
tag in the sysprep file will only affect the hostname of the guest OS, not the VM name in the cloud provider.
Option C is incorrect because calling an external Python eScript to register the VM name in DNS will not
change the VM name in the cloud provider either. Option D is incorrect because setting the VM Name field to
allow user edits at launch will require manual input from the user for each VM, which is not scalable or
automated.

In order to add users to a Project, the Prism Central administrator must first configure an Authentication
Directory. This is a service that provides user authentication and authorization for Prism Central, such as
Active Directory or OpenLDAP. By configuring an Authentication Directory, the administrator can enable
users to log in to Prism Central using their existing credentials and assign them roles and permissions based on
their group membership. The administrator can also create local user accounts for users who do not belong to
any Authentication Directory.

Question #:79
An administrator has built a Playbook to run a Powershell script in a VM when a specific alert is generated.
Several days later, the alert is generated, but the script does not execute and there are no Plays recorded for the
Playbook.
What is causing this issue?
A. The Playbook was never enabled.
B. The version of Playbooks is not correct for the version of Prism Central.
C. The script executed, but closed with an error code.
D. The path to the script was not correct.
Answer: A

Explanation
A Playbook is a set of actions that are triggered by an event or a schedule. To run a Playbook, it must be
enabled first. If a Playbook is not enabled, it will not respond to any events or schedules, and no Plays will be
recorded for it. Therefore, the most likely cause of the issue is that the administrator forgot to enable the
Playbook after building it. References: Nutanix Certified Professional - Multicloud Automation (NCP-MCA)

Explanation
The administrator should use a conditional playbook and create a playbook using alert to accomplish this
task. A conditional playbook is a type of playbook that allows the administrator to define different actions
based on certain conditions or criteria1. A playbook using alert is a type of playbook that is triggered by an
alert policy that monitors the VM status2. By using these two features, the administrator can create a playbook
that checks if the rebooted VM is the mission-critical VM and sends a notification to the on-call administrator,
or else sends an email to the Operations team.

Within a Calm blueprint, which two actions can an administrator apply to a Service under the Guest
Customization section? (Choose two.)
A. Apply a Cloudinit Script
B. Apply a Sysprep file
C. Modify the base OS image
D. Choose UEFI or Legacy BIOS
Answer: A B

Explanation
Within a Calm blueprint, an administrator can apply two actions to a Service under the Guest Customization
section: Apply a Cloudinit Script and Apply a Sysprep file. These actions allow the administrator to customize
the configuration and behavior of the virtual machines that are provisioned from the blueprint. A Cloudinit
Script is a set of commands or scripts that run on Linux-based virtual machines during the boot process. A
Sysprep file is a configuration file that specifies the Windows settings and options for the virtual machines.
These actions can be used to perform tasks such as setting the hostname, network configuration, user accounts,
software installation, and more. References:

The error message “INTERNAL_ERROR: ErrorCode: 9” typically indicates an issue with the SSH service on
the VMs. In this context, where a playbook is being executed to shut down Linux VMs, it’s essential that the
SSH service is running to allow for remote management and execution of commands. If the SSH service isn’t
running, the playbook won’t be able to execute commands on the VMs, leading to an internal error.

An administrator is unable to launch a Calm blueprint (new and old). Launching an existing blueprint under
this condition fails with the error message:
The project for this blueprint does not have any associated Nutanix account.
Downloading and uploading the new blueprint also fails with
Launch with Variables' Profile expected to fall as Windows Server VWs attached with deleted Account.
Please modify them to use different account and try again.
Why is the administrator seeing this issue?
A. The account is in a failed state.
B. The has not been created.
C. The account is not verified.
D. The account been deleted.
Answer: D
The error messages indicate that the blueprint is trying to use a Nutanix account that no longer exists. This
could happen if the account was deleted by another administrator or by a playbook action. The administrator
should check the project settings and verify that the Nutanix account is still available and associated with the
project. If not, the administrator should create a new account or use an existing one and update the blueprint
accordingly. References: Nutanix Certified Professional - Multicloud Automation (NCP-MCA) 6.5 Exam

Question #:83
An end user for an application that has been assigned the Consumer role within the project has noticed
multiple issues with a blueprint that need to be addressed. The decision has been made to bring the end user
onto the team to be able to modify the blueprints for this project.
Using the concept of least privilege, what role should the end user be assigned?
A. Developer
B. Project Admin
C. Consumer
D. Operator
Answer: A

Explanation
The Developer role is the most appropriate role for the end user who needs to modify the blueprints for the
project. The Developer role allows the user to create, edit, and delete blueprints and runbooks within the
project, as well as launch and manage applications from the Marketplace. The Developer role does not have
the privileges to create or manage projects, users, roles, or categories, which are reserved for the Project
Admin role. The Consumer role only allows the user to launch and manage applications from the Marketplace,
but not to modify the blueprints or runbooks. The Operator role allows the user to monitor and manage the
infrastructure and applications within the project, but not to create or edit the blueprints or runbooks.

What is the cause of this error message?
A. The Powershell script has an error in the code and cannot be executed as designed.
B. CredSSP has not been enabled on the Windows Operating System.
C. The version of PowerShell is incorrect.
D. Self-Service cannot communicate with the newly provisioned VM.
Answer: B

Explanation
The error message "A specified logon session does not exist. It may already have been terminated" is often
caused by the lack of CredSSP (Credential Security Support Provider) being enabled on the Windows
Operating System. CredSSP is necessary for certain remote operations, including executing PowerShell scripts
remotely.

Nutanix - NCP-MCA

Explanation
In order to enable the developer to complete the requested task, AWS and Azure Providers need to be created
(Option A). This is because, in the context of Nutanix Calm, providers are integrations with public and private
cloud infrastructures. The developer is trying to deploy an application on AWS and Azure clouds but currently
only has Nutanix as a configured provider. After creating the providers, they need to be added to the project
(Option B) so that applications can be deployed on them. Option C is incorrect because environments are not
required for multicloud deployments. Option D is also incorrect because Calm version 3.2.x is not relevant to
the question.

Question #:86
Refer to the exhibit.

A Blueprint fails on executing a check-login task against a Windows 2016 VM and displays the error shown in
the exhibit. The administrator is using a SSH key-based credential to authenticate the task.
What should the administrator change to resolve the issue?
A. Increase the retries to allow for the task to complete.
B. Change to password authentication credential.
C. Ensure the private key for the credential is correct.
D. Modify the timeout to give the task longer to complete.
Answer: C

Explanation
The error message “Authentication by <Credential_type> failed” typically indicates an issue with the
authentication credentials being used. Since the administrator is using SSH key-based credential to
authenticate, it’s essential to ensure that the private key associated with this credential is correct and

accessible. If there’s an issue with the private key, such as it being incorrect or inaccessible, authentication
will fail. Increasing the retries or modifying the timeout will not help if the credential is invalid. Changing to
password authentication credential may work, but it’s not the best option as it may compromise security and
require additional configuration. References:

Where in Calm would the administrator enable Showback?
A. Marketplace
B. Projects
C. Setting
D. LCM
Answer: C

Explanation
Showback is a feature in Calm that allows administrators to track and report the costs of running applications
and projects on different cloud platforms. Showback can be enabled in the Setting menu of Calm, under
the Showback tab. There, the administrator can configure the cost models, cloud accounts, and currency for
Showback. Showback can also be accessed from the Dashboard menu, where the administrator can view the
cost reports and charts for different applications and projects. References:

team when it is executed.
What is the easiest way to satisfy this request?
A. Modify the script to include a function to format the output of the script and email the output to the
desired address.
B. Add an Email action to the end of the existing playbook and use the {{action [index].response_body}}
parameter in the Message field.
C. Direct the output of the script to a file and use the Send Email with Payload action at the end of your
existing playbook.
D. Add an Email action to the end of the existing playbook and use the {{action[index] .stdout}} parameter
in the Message field.
Answer: D

Explanation
The easiest way to satisfy the request is to add an Email action to the end of the existing playbook and use the
{{action[index] .stdout}} parameter in the Message field. This way, the administrator does not need to modify
the script or create a file to store the output. The {{action[index] .stdout}} parameter will capture the standard
output of the previous action, which is the VM SSH action that executes the script. The Email action will then
send the output as the message body to the specified recipients. References: You can find more information

Pass Your Certification With Marks4sure Guarantee

67 of 141

Practice Test

Nutanix - NCP-MCA

C. Expected resource utilization under load
D. If the application needs to be highly available
Answer: B C

Explanation
To effectively automate the scaling of the environment, the administrator needs to know the steady state
resource utilization and the expected resource utilization under load of the application, database, and web
VMs. These two pieces of information will help the administrator to define the scaling policies, thresholds,
and actions for the blueprint service that deploys the infrastructure. The administrator can use the Self-Service
feature of Nutanix Multicloud Automation to create a blueprint service that can scale up or down based on the
resource utilization metrics. The administrator can also use the Runbook feature to automate the scaling
actions using scripts or APIs.
The other options are incorrect because:
SLA uptime of the application: This is not a piece of information that is needed to automate the scaling
of the environment. The SLA uptime of the application is a performance indicator that measures the
availability and reliability of the application. The administrator can use the X-Play feature of Nutanix
Multicloud Automation to create event-driven playbooks that can trigger actions based on alerts or
schedules to ensure the SLA uptime of the application.
If the application needs to be highly available: This is not a piece of information that is needed to
automate the scaling of the environment. The high availability of the application is a design
consideration that affects the architecture and configuration of the infrastructure and the application. The
administrator can use the Projects feature of Nutanix Multicloud Automation to create projects that can
define the availability domains, networks, and storage for the infrastructure and the application.

Question #:91
An administrator has been tasked with creating a multicloud, three-tier application using Calm. The
application needs to consist of:
A MongoDB backend database
A NodeJS Javascript runtime environment
An NGINX webserver
The administrator has access to an AWS account, as well as a locally hosted Nutanix cluster. The three parts
of the application should be fully redundant, and be able to tolerate either a cloud provider outage, or a local
Nutanix cluster outage.
What is the most appropriate solution the administrator should choose in order to meet the requirements?
A. Create a Calm blueprint with MongoDB, Node/S, and NGINX VMs running on Nutanix, as well as an
NGINX server running in AWS on US-WEST-1 and US-EAST-1.
B. Create a Calm blueprint with MongoDB, Node/S and NGINX VMs running on Nutanix, and a separate
blueprint for MongoDB, NodeJS, and NGINX running in AWS on US-WEST-1 and US-EAST-1.
C. Create a Calm blueprint with MongoDB, NodelS, and NGINX VMs running on Nutanix, as well as
MongoDB, NodeJS, and NGINX servers running in AWS on US-WEST-1 and US-EAST-1.

US-EAST-1.
Answer: C

Explanation
This solution meets the requirements of creating a multicloud, three-tier application using Calm. It ensures that
each tier of the application has a redundant copy running on both Nutanix and AWS, and that the application
can tolerate either a cloud provider outage or a local Nutanix cluster outage. The other options do not provide
full redundancy for each tier, or require manual intervention to create the AWS instances. References: Nutanix

Question #:93
Where can an administrator view the last two actions taken by a single VM blueprint?
A. AMIS tab
B. service tab
C. Metrics tab
D. History Tab
Answer: D

Explanation
To view the last two actions taken by a single VM blueprint, the administrator should go to the History Tab.
This tab shows the history of all the actions performed on the blueprint, such as launch, update, delete, etc.
The administrator can filter the history by date, action, status, and user. The history tab also provides details of
each action, such as the start time, end time, duration, and logs.
The other three options are not correct because:
The AMIS tab shows the list of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that are available for the
blueprint. The administrator can use this tab to select an AMI for the blueprint or create a custom
AMI.
The service tab shows the list of services that are part of the blueprint. The administrator can use
this tab to add, edit, or delete services, as well as configure the dependencies, tasks, and variables
for each service.
The Metrics tab shows the performance metrics of the blueprint, such as CPU, memory, disk, and
network usage. The administrator can use this tab to monitor the health and performance of the
blueprint and its services. References:

A. Publish the task to Github select the task from the Github Repository from the other blueprint.
B. Publish the task to the Marketplace, select the task from the Marketplace from the other blueprint.
C. Publish the task to the Task Repository, select the task from the Task Repository from the other
blueprint.
D. Publish the task to the Task Library select the task from the Task Library from the other blueprint.
Answer: D

Explanation
The Task Library is a centralized repository of tasks that can be reused across multiple blueprints. The
administrator can publish a task to the Task Library by clicking on the Publish icon in the task editor. The task
will then be available in the Task Library tab under the Tasks section in the Calm UI. The administrator can
select the task from the Task Library and drag and drop it into another blueprint. This way, the administrator
can reuse the task with the least amount of effort.

Question #:96
An administrator has an existing set of VMs that were deployed before the company started using Calm. The
administrator would like to now use Calm to manage those existing VMs.
What should the administrator do to manage the existing VMs?
A. Create a Greenfield Application, select the snapshots of the VMs to manage and redeploy the VMs from
the latest snapshot.
B. Create a Brownfield Application, select the VMs that are needed for each deployment from the drop
down list.
C. Create a Greenfield Application, select the VMs that are needed for each deployment from the drop
down list.
D. Create a Brownfield Application, select the snapshots of the VMs to manage and redeploy the VMs
from the latest snapshot.
Answer: B

Explanation
A Brownfield Application is a type of application that allows you to import and manage existing VMs that
were not deployed by Calm. You can use a Brownfield Application to perform actions such as start, stop,
restart, delete, or execute scripts on the imported VMs. You can also add services, credentials, variables, and
policies to the Brownfield Application blueprint. To create a Brownfield Application, you need to select a
multi-VM blueprint and then choose the VMs that you want to include in the application from the drop down
list. You can also filter the VMs by name, cluster, or power state.
A Greenfield Application is a type of application that allows you to deploy new VMs from scratch using
Calm. You can use a Greenfield Application to provision and configure VMs on different cloud platforms,
such as Nutanix AHV, VMware ESXi, AWS, Azure, or GCP. You can also add services, credentials,
variables, and policies to the Greenfield Application blueprint. To create a Greenfield Application, you need to
select a single-VM or a multi-VM blueprint and then specify the VM properties, such as name, image, flavor,
network, storage, etc.

Question #:97
An administrator is deploying a Windows VM from a Blueprint. As a step in the Blueprint, a PowerShell
script needs to run on the target. VM. The communication between Calm and the VM is secured.
Which inbound port need to be opened for the PowerShell script to run on the VM?
A. 1433
B. 3389
C. 5986
D. 5985
Answer: C

Explanation
The port 5986 is used for PowerShell Remoting over HTTPS, which is a secure way of executing PowerShell
commands on a remote Windows VM. Calm uses PowerShell Remoting to run scripts on Windows VMs as
part of the blueprint actions. Therefore, the port 5986 needs to be opened on the VM firewall to allow the
communication between Calm and the VM. The other ports are not related to PowerShell Remoting, as they
are used for SQL Server (1433), Remote Desktop Protocol (3389), and PowerShell Remoting over HTTP
(5985). References: Nutanix Certified Professional - Multicloud Automation (NCP-MCA) 6.5 Exam Blueprint

The error indicates that there is an issue with DNS resolution while executing the delete script. To resolve this
and successfully delete the deployment, the administrator can:
Perform a Stop: Stop the application or VM to ensure that no processes are actively using the
resources. This might resolve any temporary network or DNS issues.
Manually delete the VM: If stopping the application does not resolve the issue, manually deleting the
VM from the Prism Central or the respective hypervisor management console is necessary. This will
bypass the script error.

Which trigger should the administrator use to satisfy this requirement?
A. Event, where event type is Restored VM from Snapshot and Target VM is the specific VMS.
B. Event, where the event is Snapshot Restoration, and the Target VM is VMS in Environment: Dev
C. Alerts Matching Criteria. where alert type is Snapshot Restoration, and the criteria is the VM names.
D. Alert. where alert type is Restored VM from Snapshot and target VM Category is Environment: Dev
Answer: B

Explanation
An event trigger is a type of trigger that can be used to execute a playbook when a specific event occurs in the
Nutanix platform. An event trigger can be configured with various parameters, such as the event type, the
target VM, the target VM category, the target project, and the target user. In this scenario, the administrator
wants to be notified when a subset of VMs within the Environment:Dev category is restored from snapshot.
Therefore, the event trigger should have the following parameters:
Event type: Snapshot Restoration. This is the event that indicates a VM has been restored from a
snapshot.
Target VM: VMS in Environment: Dev. This is the filter that specifies which VMs are relevant for the
trigger. By selecting VMS in Environment: Dev, the trigger will only apply to the VMs that belong to
the Environment:Dev category.
Other parameters: These can be left as default or customized as needed.

A category is a key-value pair that can be assigned to an entity in Prism Central to simplify daily operations
and management. Categories can be used to filter, search, and group entities based on common attributes.
Categories can also be used to define policies and permissions for different entities. A category can be
assigned to a cluster, a VM, an image, a network, a blueprint, an application, or a project. A category cannot
be assigned to a hypervisor, a protection domain, or a storage container, as these are not entities in Prism
Central. References: Nutanix Certified Professional - Multicloud Automation (NCP-MCA) Exam Blueprint

Question #:105
An administrator needs to deploy blueprints to Calm SaaS and begin executing them, Before the administrator
can execute a blueprint, what must be configured in the environment where the blueprint will be deployed?
A. vpc
B. Site-to-Site VPN Tunnel
C. VPN Client
D. Tunnel Entity
Answer: B

Explanation
To deploy blueprints to Calm SaaS and execute them, the administrator must first configure a site-to-site VPN
tunnel and a tunnel entity in the environment where the blueprint will be deployed. A site-to-site VPN tunnel
is a secure connection between two networks over the internet that allows Calm SaaS to communicate with the
on-premises or cloud environment. A tunnel entity is a logical representation of the VPN tunnel in Calm SaaS
that contains the tunnel configuration and credentials. The administrator must also register the environment
and the provider accounts in Calm SaaS before deploying the blueprints. References: Nutanix Certified

Nutanix - NCP-MCA

Which option is used to test or validate scripts before deployment?
A. Test Script
B. EScript
C. PowerShell
D. Shell
Answer: A

Explanation
Test Script is a feature of Nutanix Cloud Manager (NCM) Self-Service that allows users to test or validate
scripts before deployment. Test Script enables users to run scripts on a VM without creating a blueprint or a
runbook. Users can select a VM, choose a script type, enter the script content, and execute the script. The
output of the script is displayed in the Test Script window. Test Script can be used to troubleshoot errors,
verify functionality, or preview the results of a script before using it in a blueprint or a
runbook. References: Nutanix Certified Professional - Multicloud Automation (NCP-MCA) Exam Blueprint

Question #:107
An administrator did not specify scripts under any of the Stop service-level actions, so the system didn’t
generate any orchestration edges.
What should the administrator do to prevent this?
A. Manually do the update for all system-defined actions.
B. Manually create a package for all system-defined actions.
C. Manually do an API call for all system-defined actions.
D. Manually create a dependency for all system-defined actions.
Answer: A

Explanation
When scripts are not specified under the Stop service-level actions, the system does not generate orchestration
edges automatically. To prevent this issue, the administrator should manually update all system-defined
actions. This involves defining the necessary scripts or actions to ensure proper orchestration and
dependencies are in place.

What are the two Calm SaaS API Key components? (Choose two.)
A. SaaS Token
B. Token
C. JSON file
D. Name
Answer: B D

Explanation
The Calm SaaS API key consists of two components: name and token. The name component is analogous to
the ID or username you provide when you configure your Calm tunnel client VM to establish the tunnel
connection. The token component is analogous to the password portion of the HTTP basic authentication. The
Calm SaaS API key is used along with the Calm APIs and Calm DSL to access Calm. The API key file that
you download will have the name and token components in the JSON format. References: Nutanix Support &

RAM: 8 GB
OS: Windows 2016
Hypervisor: AHV
What caused this Playbook to fail?
A. This play cannot be executed against a VM on AHV.
B. The VM needs to be powered off before vCPU can be reduced.
C. Reduction of vCPU cannot be done on a VM with a running snapshot.
D. The play will cause the VM to go below the minimum vCPU.
Answer: C

Explanation
The Playbook is designed to manually reduce the vCPU count on any selected VM within the environment.
However, it failed during a test run on VM2 because there was a running snapshot of the VM. According to
Nutanix Multicloud Automation (NCP-MCA) principles, you cannot reduce the vCPU count on a VM that has
an active snapshot1. This is because the snapshot captures the state of the VM configuration and data, and
reverting to a snapshot will restore both the guest OS and the virtual hardware2. Therefore, changing the
vCPU count while a snapshot is running will cause inconsistency and error. The other options are incorrect
because:
A. The Playbook can be executed against a VM on AHV, as long as there is no snapshot running3.
B. The VM does not need to be powered off before vCPU can be reduced, as this can be done using
hot-plug CPU feature4.
D. The play will not cause the VM to go below the minimum vCPU, as the minimum number of vCPUs
is set to 1 in the Playbook, and the VM has 4 vCPUs initially. References: Nutanix Support &

How can this be achieved?
A. Create an NCC alert based on performance data.
B. Create an Alert policy for Category Env:Production.
C. Create an Alert policy for all VMs.
D. Create a script from the Guest OS for the alert.
Answer: B

Explanation
To create a custom alert policy, the administrator needs to specify the entity type, the impact, the severity, the
condition, and the notification method. In this case, the entity type is VM, the impact is performance, the
severity is warning, the condition is CPU usage > 70%, and the notification method is email. Additionally, the
administrator can use categories to filter the entities that are affected by the alert policy. By selecting the
category Env:Production, the administrator can limit the alert policy to only apply to the production VMs.

Question #:115
An administrator is trying to delete a category, but the option is greyed out.
Which two conditions could be causing this issue? (Choose two.)
A. The category is system defined.
B. The category is assigned to powered-on VMs.
C. The category is part of a flow policy.
D. The category is user defined.
Answer: A C

Explanation
Categories are key-value pairs that you can use to tag and filter entities in Nutanix. There are two types of
categories: system defined and user defined. System defined categories are built-in and cannot be deleted. User
defined categories are created by the administrator and can be deleted if they are not used in any policy.
Policies are rules that apply actions or restrictions to entities based on their categories. Flow policies are
policies that control the network security and visibility of VMs. If a category is part of a flow policy, it cannot
be deleted unless the policy is removed or modified. Therefore, the two conditions that could prevent an
administrator from deleting a category are: the category is system defined, or the category is part of a flow
policy. References:

Question #:117
A company has a business-critical VM. The VM Utilization of CPU and memory differs from time to time, but
can never be allowed to run out of resources. The administrator also wants to make sure that the VM is not
over provisioned when not needed.
The administrator determines these requirements that have been validated and automated in a test environment
should also apply for the production environment:
VCPU needs to be added when CPU Utilization been over 80% for 15 minutes.
Memory needs to be increased by 4 GB when utilization reaches 80%.
Return of over-allocated resources must not affect other business applications.
What can the administrator do with the least amount of effort to make sure the VM is always performant and
returns resources when not required?
A. Clone and adjust the system-created playbooks
B. Import the playbook and adjust the values
C. Create a blueprint based on requirements
D. Create a task based on requirements
Answer: B

Explanation
The easiest way to automate the VM utilization and resource allocation is to use a playbook that has been
already tested and validated in a test environment. A playbook is a collection of actions that can be triggered
by events or schedules to perform various tasks on the Nutanix platform. By importing the playbook from the
test environment to the production environment, the administrator can save time and effort in creating a new
playbook from scratch. The administrator only needs to adjust the values of the playbook parameters, such as
the VM name, the CPU and memory thresholds, the VCPU and memory increments, and the notification
settings, to match the production environment. The playbook can then be executed manually or automatically
based on the desired frequency and conditions.

Nutanix - NCP-MCA

Explanation
A time trigger is a type of playbook trigger that allows the user to specify a schedule for running a playbook.
This trigger is useful for automating tasks that need to be performed periodically or at a specific time. A
manual trigger requires the user to initiate the playbook execution manually, which is not ideal for a recurring
task. A report trigger is a type of playbook trigger that allows the user to run a playbook when a specific report
is generated. However, this trigger does not guarantee that the report will be generated on the first of every
month, as it depends on the report settings. A wait until day of month action is a type of playbook action that
pauses the playbook execution until a specified day of the month. This action is unnecessary if the playbook
already has a time trigger that specifies the desired schedule.

Answer: B

Explanation
Playbooks are a feature of X-Play that allow you to automate tasks based on events or alerts. You can use the
actions gallery to select from a variety of actions that can be executed by a playbook. These actions are
categorized into three types: VM, alert, and communication1. VM actions allow you to perform operations on
virtual machines, such as power on, power off, snapshot, clone, etc. Alert actions allow you to create, update,
or close alerts in Prism Central. Communication actions allow you to send messages to various channels, such
as email, Slack, or Microsoft Teams2. Therefore, the correct answer is B. References:

An administrator wants to execute a post-create task that will trigger an API call to create a front end
application.
Which task type should the administrator use?
A. HTTP
B. Predefined
C. eScript
D. Simple
Answer: A

Explanation
A post-create task is a task that runs after a blueprint or runbook deployment is completed. A post-create task
can be used to perform additional configuration or automation on the deployed resources. An HTTP task is a
task that executes an HTTP request to a specified URL, with optional headers, body, and authentication. An
HTTP task can be used to trigger an API call to another system or service, such as creating a front end
application. A predefined task is a task that uses a predefined script or command to perform a common
operation, such as installing a package or running a service. A predefined task cannot be used to trigger an API
call to another system or service. An eScript task is a task that executes a custom script written in JavaScript or
Python. An eScript task can be used to perform complex logic or operations that are not available in
predefined tasks. However, an eScript task requires more coding skills and testing than an HTTP task. A
simple task is a task that executes a simple command or script on the target VM or host. A simple task cannot
be used to trigger an API call to another system or service. References:

Question #:124
Prism Central reporting indicates that there are multiple memory-constrained VMs in multiple clusters. The
target VMs have Memory Hot Add enabled.
Using X-Play, in what order should the Playbook actions be added to ensure the VMs are properly
remediated?
A. VM add Memory, Take a VM Snapshot, Resolve Alert
B. Take a VM Snapshot, Power Off VM, VM Add Memory, Resolve Alert, Power on VM
C. Take a VM Snapshot, VM add Memory, Resolve Alert
D. Power off VM, Take a VM Snapshot, VM add Memory, Resolve Alert
Answer: C

Explanation
To ensure the VMs are properly remediated, the Playbook actions should be added in the following order:
Take a VM Snapshot, VM add Memory, Resolve Alert. This is because Memory Hot Add allows the
administrator to increase the memory allocation of a running VM without powering it off. Taking a VM
snapshot before adding memory provides a backup point in case of any issues. Resolving the alert after adding
memory clears the notification and updates the status of the VM. Powering off the VM is not necessary and
may cause downtime or disruption to the applications running on the VM. References: Nutanix Certified

How should the developer satisfy this requirement?
A. Use an application profile.
B. Use Service dependency.
C. Use a Pre-create task.
D. Use an HTTP task.
Answer: D

Explanation
An HTTP task is a type of task that can be added to a blueprint or a runbook to perform REST API calls to
external systems. An HTTP task can be used to reserve an IP address in the IPAM system before deploying a
VM or an application, by sending a POST request with the required parameters and headers. The HTTP task
can also capture the response from the IPAM system and store it as a variable for later use. This is the simplest
and most efficient way to integrate with an IPAM system, as it does not require any additional configuration or
scripting.

A. CPU can be added to a powered on VM if the guest OS supports it
B. VM must be powered off to add CPU
C. VM must be powered off to reduce memory
D. Memory can be removed from a powered on VM if the guest OS supports it
Answer: A D

Explanation
When configuring Playbooks to automate the scaling of CPU and memory resources for VMs, the
administrator should consider the following prerequisites:
CPU can be added to a powered on VM if the guest OS supports it. This is also known as hot-plug CPU.
The administrator should check the compatibility of the guest OS and the hypervisor before enabling
this feature. For example, Windows Server 2019 supports hot-plug CPU on AHV, ESXi, and Hyper-V,
but not on XenServer1.
Memory can be removed from a powered on VM if the guest OS supports it. This is also known as
hot-unplug memory. The administrator should check the compatibility of the guest OS and the
hypervisor before enabling this feature. For example, Linux supports hot-unplug memory on AHV,
ESXi, and XenServer, but not on Hyper-V2.
VM must be powered off to add CPU if the guest OS does not support hot-plug CPU. This is also
known as cold-plug CPU. The administrator should plan for the downtime required to power off and
power on the VM after adding CPU.
VM must be powered off to reduce memory if the guest OS does not support hot-unplug memory. This
is also known as cold-unplug memory. The administrator should plan for the downtime required to
power off and power on the VM after reducing memory. References: Nutanix Multicloud Automation

Practice Test

Nutanix - NCP-MCA

Explanation
An X-Play Trigger is a condition that initiates a Playbook. There are four types of X-Play Triggers: Alert,
Audit, Event, and Time1. An Alert Trigger is based on a Prism alert, such as a VM power state change or a
disk failure. An Audit Trigger is based on a Prism audit entry, such as a user login or a cluster operation. An
Event Trigger is based on a Prism event, such as a VM creation or deletion. A Time Trigger is based on a
schedule, such as daily, weekly, or monthly2. In this scenario, the administrator needs to create a Playbook to
be notified when VMs are deleted. Therefore, the appropriate X-Play Trigger would be an Event Trigger, since
VM deletion is a Prism event. References: 1: Nutanix Certified Professional - Multicloud Automation

Nutanix - NCP-MCA

Explanation
According to the Nutanix Prism Central Guide1, categories are key-value pairs that can be assigned to entities
such as VMs, images, blueprints, etc. Categories can be used to filter, group, and manage entities based on
their attributes. To review and clean up all existing categories within the Nutanix environment, the
administrator should filter on the name, value, entities, and policies of the categories. The name and value of
the categories identify the category type and the category value respectively. The entities show how many and
which entities are assigned to the category. The policies show how many and which policies are associated
with the category. By filtering on these information, the administrator can organize the findings and eliminate
unused categories. References:

Question #:132
A customer is trying to deploy an application with Calm and receives this error for a Linux VM:

What is the cause of this error within the blueprint?
A. Connection section has a network adapter selected for the Address box in Connection section.
B. Connection section has no network adapters selected for the Address box in Connection section.
C. Connection Type has a protocol selected.
D. Connection Type has no protocol selected.
Answer: B

Explanation
In the context of deploying an application with Calm, if a customer receives an error for a Linux VM, it could
be due to the absence of network adapters selected for the Address box in the Connection section within the
blueprint. This means that there is no specified network connection for the VM, leading to a failure in script
execution.

Question #:133
Which Calm feature provides the ability for administrators to approve Single or Multi-VM Blueprints for
assignment to Projects?
A. Application Manager
B. Marketplace
C. Projects
D. Marketplace Manager
Answer: D

Explanation
The alert in Prism Central indicates that Calm showback is not able to reach the beam service. This could be
due to network connectivity issues or incorrect configurations. The administrator should check the DNS
configuration in Prism Central (Option A) to ensure that it is correctly configured to allow communication
with the Beam service. Additionally, checking if Prism Element is configured with Proxy settings (Option C)
is essential as it can also affect the communication between Calm and Beam. Pulse (Option B) and Flow
(Option D) are not related to the Calm showback feature and do not impact its functionality.

C. User is not authorized to launch Blueprints.
D. The credential in the Project Environment is invalid.
Answer: D

Explanation
When a Blueprint is launched via Marketplace, it uses the credential that is configured in the Project
Environment. If the credential is invalid, the Blueprint deployment will fail with a check login error. To fix
this issue, the developer needs to verify and update the credential in the Project Environment and ensure that it
has the required permissions to access the target infrastructure and applications. References: Nutanix

Question #:135
A company's NOC personnel have a custom Python script they run manually by logging into each VM to fix a
common issue across all of the corporate VMs. Management has no audit history of who is running the script
or when it is occurring. The company has recently implemented Calm and management has asked its
administrators to accomplish these tasks:
Reduce the manual effort for the NOC personnel.
Ensure the process is repeatable across all applications.
Provide audit history for management of the actions.
Which two actions should the administrators take to accomplish these tasks? (Choose two.)
A. Create a new Action, Add an Execute task with a script type of EScript, paste the custom script into the
action
B. View the Execution History tab under the Runbook page for audit purposes
C. Create a new Runbook Add an Execute task with a script type of EScript paste the custom script into the
action
D. View the Audit tab under the Application view for audit purposes
Answer: A C

Explanation
To reduce the manual effort for the NOC personnel, the administrators can create a new Action that contains
the custom Python script as an Execute task with a script type of EScript. This will allow the NOC personnel
to run the script on any VM from the Calm UI or API without logging into each VM. To ensure the process is
repeatable across all applications, the administrators can create a new Runbook that contains the same Action
and assign it to the relevant Projects. This will enable the NOC personnel to run the script on multiple VMs
across different applications in a single workflow. To provide audit history for management of the actions, the

administrators can view the Execution History tab under the Runbook page for audit purposes. This will show
the details of each Runbook execution, such as the status, duration, user, and logs. Alternatively, the
administrators can also view the Audit tab under the Application view for audit purposes. This will show the
history of all actions performed on the application, such as launch, update, delete, and run
actions. References: Nutanix Certified Professional - Multicloud Automation (NCP-MCA) Exam Blueprint

Question #:136
An administrator needs to run a blueprint deployment and tasks in a different Prism Central (PC) instance than
the PC instance running Self-Service (formerly Calm).
How should the administrator satisfy this requirement?
A. Add a remove Prism Central instance as an account.
B. Add a remote Prism Element instance as an account.
C. Export the blueprint to the remote Prism Central.
D. Export the package to the remote Prism Central.
Answer: A

Explanation
To run a blueprint deployment and tasks in a different Prism Central instance than the one running
Self-Service (formerly Calm), the administrator should add the remote Prism Central instance as an account.
This configuration allows Self-Service to interact with multiple Prism Central instances, enabling the
management and deployment of blueprints across different environments.

Practice Test

Nutanix - NCP-MCA

Answer: B

Explanation
In Nutanix's Multicloud Automation (formerly known as Calm), playbooks can be configured to respond to
various conditions and events that occur within the infrastructure. If a VM, such as one named ORACLE,
becomes CPU constrained, a playbook can be triggered to automatically add more virtual CPUs (vCPUs) to
the VM. In addition, playbooks can integrate with various notification services such as Slack, allowing
administrators to be informed of the changes being made.
Based on the provided options and according to Nutanix documentation, the correct action is that the playbook
will add more vCPU and will send a Slack message. This ensures that the VM's performance can be adjusted
dynamically while keeping the relevant personnel informed via Slack.

Question #:138
What two pieces of information can an administrator obtain from Plays? (Choose two.)
A. Host where the action runs
B. Start time and end time of each action
C. Execution result status
D. CVM IP where the alert was triggered
Answer: A C

Explanation
Plays are event-driven automation workflows that can be triggered by alerts, schedules, or manual actions.
They consist of one or more actions that run on specified hosts or clusters. An administrator can obtain the
following information from Plays:
Host where the action runs: Each action in a Play can be configured to run on a specific host or cluster,
or on the host or cluster where the alert was triggered. The administrator can view the host or cluster
name for each action in the Play details page.
Execution result status: Each action in a Play has an execution result status that indicates whether the
action was successful, failed, skipped, or cancelled. The administrator can view the status for each
action in the Play details page, as well as the overall status of the Play.
The other options are incorrect because:

Start time and end time of each action: Plays do not show the start time and end time of each action,
only the duration of the action. The administrator can view the duration for each action in the Play
details page, as well as the overall duration of the Play.
CVM IP where the alert was triggered: Plays do not show the CVM IP where the alert was triggered,
only the host or cluster name where the alert was triggered. The administrator can view the host or
cluster name for the alert in the Play details page.

Question #:139
An administrator wants to create two database VMS using replicas and needs to access the same mount_path
for hosting the backup files during the deployment on both VMs,
What should the administrator do on the Blueprint to achieve this requirement?
A. Set mount_path = u01/app/backup as a runtime variable
B. Set mount_path = u01/app/backup as a runtime replica
C. Set mount_path = u01/app/backup as a runtime task
D. Set mount_path = u01/app/backup as a runtime service
Answer: A

Explanation
Runtime variables are used to pass information between different components of a Blueprint, such as VMs,
services, tasks, and replicas. They can be defined in the Blueprint YAML file or in the UI. By setting the
mount_path as a runtime variable, the administrator can ensure that both database VMs use the same value for
the mount_path during the deployment. This way, the backup files can be hosted on the same location for both
VMs. References:

Question #:146
A blueprint was developed for deploying a standard 3-tier hosting environment for a company's applications.
The blueprint includes a load balancer, multiple web servers, a database server, and a small test application.
During testing of the blueprint, the application fails to connect to the database. The cause is found to be the
database software is still installing when the application starts.
Which method most efficiently prevents the application from starting before the database?
A. Use a local install instead of downloading
B. Create a loop to retry connection
C. Create a service dependency
D. Use a sleep statement in a start script
Answer: C

Explanation
A service dependency is a feature of Nutanix Calm that allows you to define the order of execution and the
conditions for starting and stopping services in a blueprint. By creating a service dependency between the
application and the database, you can ensure that the application will not start until the database is fully
installed and ready. This avoids the need for manual intervention or inefficient workarounds like loops or sleep
statements. References: Nutanix Multicloud Automation Administration (NMCAA), page 41; Nutanix

(Choose two.)
A. Create a playbook REST API action to delete the VM from a ServiceNow approval flow.
B. Create a playbook webhook action to delete the VM from a ServiceNow approval flow.
C. Create a playbook webhook trigger to delete the VM from a ServiceNow approval flow.
D. Create a playbook REST API trigger to delete the VM from a ServiceNow approval flow.
Answer: A B

Explanation
A playbook REST API action allows the administrator to send an HTTP request to a specified endpoint, such
as the Prism Central API, to perform an operation, such as deleting a VM. A playbook webhook action allows
the administrator to send a payload to a specified URL, such as a ServiceNow webhook, to trigger an event,
such as an approval flow. Both of these actions can be used to automate the deletion of VMs from a
ServiceNow approval flow, where the developers can request and confirm the removal of their environments.
A playbook webhook trigger and a playbook REST API trigger are not valid options, as they are used to
initiate a playbook based on an external event, not to perform an action within a
playbook. References: Nutanix Certified Professional - Multicloud Automation (NCP-MCA) 6.5 Exam

Question #:155
An administrator needs to notify the on-call pager after hours using their PagerDuty incident management
platform.
How should the administrator integrate notifications via PagerDuty in a Playbook using the least number of
configurations possible?
A. Create an action to notify PagerDuty via IP address.
B. Create an action to send an alert to PagerDuty'.
C. Send Alert to Webhook which will use APIs to send notification to PagerDuty.
D. Send Alert to Nutanix v3 API which will use APIs to send notification to PagerDuty.
Answer: C

Explanation
The Send Alert to Webhook action allows the administrator to send an HTTP request to a specified URL,
which can be used to trigger a PagerDuty incident via its REST API1. This action requires the least number of
configurations compared to the other options, as it only needs the webhook URL, the HTTP method, and the
payload. The other options would require additional steps, such as creating a custom action, configuring the IP
address, or using the Nutanix v3 API, which is not designed for integrating with third-party services.

Question #:158
A developer has created a variable type that should be used for all deployments. However, when an
administrator is creating a blueprint, the variable is not available.
What must the developer do to make it visible?
A. Share the variable with the project.
B. Publish the variable to Marketplace.
C. Add the administrator to the Developer role.
D. Add the administrator to the Project Admin role.
Answer: A

Explanation
A variable is a placeholder for a value that can be used in a blueprint or a script. A variable can be defined at
the global, project, or blueprint level. A global variable is available to all projects and blueprints, while a
project variable is available to all blueprints within a project, and a blueprint variable is available only to the
blueprint where it is defined. To make a variable visible to a blueprint, the developer needs to share the
variable with the project that contains the blueprint. This can be done by going to the Variables page in the
Calm UI and clicking on the Share button next to the variable name. Then, the developer needs to select the
project from the drop-down list and click on Save. References: Nutanix Certified Professional - Multicloud

Answer: A C

Explanation
To create an application blueprint for AWS and Azure in Nutanix Calm, the Blueprint Developer needs to
complete the following actions:
Create AWS and Azure Accounts: These accounts must be created and configured within Nutanix
Calm to allow integration with the respective cloud providers.
Add the provider Accounts to the project: Once the accounts are created, they need to be added to the
specific project in which the blueprint will be developed. This ensures that the blueprint can use the
resources and configurations associated with these accounts.

When configuring Calm to use Kubernetes as a provider, what two options does an administrator have as
Kubernetes types? (Choose two.)
A. Rancher
B. Karbon
C. OpenShift
D. Vanilla
Answer: B D

Explanation
When configuring Calm to use Kubernetes as a provider, the administrator can choose between two
Kubernetes types: Karbon and Vanilla. Karbon is Nutanix’s own Kubernetes distribution that is integrated
with Prism and AHV. Vanilla is any other Kubernetes distribution that is not Karbon, such as OpenShift,
Rancher, or EKS. The administrator needs to provide the Kubernetes API endpoint and credentials for the
Vanilla type, while the Karbon type is automatically discovered by Calm. References: Nutanix Certified

The current environment has the following VMS deployed:
18 VMS created pre-Calm adoption.
32 VMS created post-Calm adoption.
Which action should the administrator take to automate this deployment for existing VMs?
A. In Calm, create a Brownfield deployment attaching to both pre-Calm and post-Calm created VMS and
add the Agent installation script to the Blueprint.
B. In Calm, create an Endpoint that includes all Linux VMS and include the Endpoint a Runbook that
executes a shell script for agent installation.
C. Create a new golden image that includes the monitoring client and deploy all VMS again to bring them
under Calm management.
Answer: B

Explanation
The best option to automate the installation of the local agent on all Linux VMs is to create an Endpoint that
includes all Linux VMs and include the Endpoint in a Runbook that executes a shell script for agent
installation. This way, the administrator can leverage the Calm Runbook feature, which allows orchestrating
tasks across multiple VMs without the need of a blueprint or an application. The administrator can also filter
the VMs by name, tag, or other criteria to select the target VMs for the Endpoint. The shell script can be added
as a task in the Runbook and run on the selected Endpoint.
Option A is not correct because a Brownfield deployment is used to create an application from existing VMs
and an existing blueprint. It is not suitable for automating tasks across multiple VMs without a blueprint.
Moreover, a Brownfield deployment cannot attach to post-Calm created VMs, as they are already managed by
Calm.
Option C is not correct because creating a new golden image and deploying all VMs again is a very
time-consuming and disruptive process. It also requires the administrator to migrate the data and configuration
of the existing VMs to the new ones. This option does not leverage the Calm automation capabilities and is not
recommended. References: Nutanix Calm Runbooks & API Automation, Nutanix Support & Insights, Calm

Answer: D

Explanation
To ensure that checks can be implemented in a single task while creating an application using NDB (Nutanix

ensures the playbook is triggered based on the specified threshold.
Select Alert as the trigger:

Pass Your Certification With Marks4sure Guarantee

126 of 141

Practice Test

Nutanix - NCP-MCA
Set the alert created in step 1 as the trigger for the playbook. This ties the alert condition to the
execution of the playbook.

Select Email Action with custom message:
Add an action to send an email notification. This email should be sent prior to any work being
started, to inform relevant stakeholders about the impending vDisk growth operation.
Add Action to Grow vDisks:
Add the action to grow the vDisks on the VMs. This step should include the necessary script or
task that performs the vDisk growth operation on the specified VMs.
Based on the requirements and steps, the playbook should be structured as follows:
Step 1: Create a custom Alert Policy
Define the alert policy with the condition that disk usage on the VMs reaches 85% or higher.
Step 2: Select Alert as the trigger
Use the alert policy created in Step 1 as the trigger for the playbook.
Step 3: Select Email Action with custom message
Add an email action to notify relevant stakeholders before the vDisk growth task is initiated.
Step 4: Add Action to Grow vDisks
Include the necessary action to grow the vDisks on the VMs as required.
This structure ensures that the playbook is dynamically responsive to changes in server usage, sends
notifications prior to execution, and performs the required vDisk growth operation automatically.

Question #:167
A developer has been asked to update the existing blueprint with an additional option of scaling it both out and
in.
Where in the Blueprint Editor should the developer make the relevant changes?
A. Environment, Actions
B. Configuration, Settings
C. Blueprint, Configuration
D. Application Profile, Actions
Answer: D

Explanation
To enable scaling for a blueprint, the developer needs to add scaling actions to the application profile. Scaling
actions are scripts that define how to scale out (add more instances) or scale in (remove instances) of an
application tier. The developer can also specify the minimum and maximum number of instances allowed for
each tier, and the scaling policy (manual or automatic) based on metrics or schedules. The developer can
access the application profile from the Blueprint Editor by clicking on the application name and then selecting
the Actions tab. References: Nutanix Multicloud Automation Administration (NMCAA) course, Nutanix

Answer: B

Explanation
A Branch Condition is a type of action in X-Play that allows you to create conditional logic based on the
output of a previous action or a custom expression. A Branch Condition can have multiple branches, each with
a different condition and a different set of actions to execute if the condition is met. The minimum number of
actions required in a Branch Condition is two: one for the condition itself, and one for the action to perform if
the condition is true. If the condition is false, the Branch Condition will skip to the next action in the

Question #:172
An administrator has performed a self-Service (formerly Calm) upgrade from version 3.3 to 3.6. After
performing the upgrade, the administrator has noticed all the Policy Engine scheduled jobs are failing and this
alert is being presented in PC.

What should the administrator do to resolve the alert?
A. Upgrade Policy Engine using LCM.
B. Upgrade Engine using YUM Update.
C. Upgrade Policy Engine using APT update.
D. Reboot policy Engine VM.
Answer: A

Explanation
After upgrading Self-Service (formerly Calm) from version 3.3 to 3.6, the administrator noticed that Policy
Engine scheduled jobs were failing and an alert was being presented in Prism Central. This issue is likely due
to a version mismatch between the upgraded components. The recommended solution is to use Lifecycle

A. Contact professional services to modify the third-party tool to add the Calm integration.
B. Create a Playbook with a webhook as a trigger and a REST API call as an action
C. Create script to run the Calm scale out action.
D. Configure an alert to notify the administrator.
Answer: B

Explanation
The best way to automate the scale-out of the application layer using a third-party tool is to create a Playbook
with a webhook as a trigger and a REST API call as an action. A webhook is a mechanism that allows a
third-party service to send a notification to a Calm server when a certain event occurs, such as a code commit
or a build completion. A REST API call is a way to interact with the Calm server programmatically, such as
launching a blueprint or scaling out a service. By creating a Playbook that combines these two elements, the
administrator can enable the third-party tool to trigger the scale-out action on the Calm server with a single
command. The other options are either not feasible, not efficient, or not relevant for this
task. References: Nutanix Calm: Playbooks - Read the Docs and Nutanix Calm: REST API - Read the Docs.
Question #:174
An administrator is trying to deploy a VM from an image onto a newly-built cluster, but the image is
unavailable. The administrator is able to deploy the image onto other clusters with no issue. Image placement
policies have already been created within Prism Central.
Why is the image unavailable for deployment on the cluster?
A. The cluster does not have the proper category assigned for the placement policy,
B. The image is corrupted.
C. The image does not have the proper category assigned for the placement policy,
D. The image has not been directly uploaded to the cluster
Answer: A C

Explanation
The image is unavailable for deployment on the cluster because the cluster and the image do not have the
proper categories assigned for the placement policy. A placement policy is a set of rules that determines which
clusters and images are available for VM deployment based on the categories and values assigned to them. If
the cluster and the image do not match the placement policy criteria, they will not be shown as options for VM
deployment. Therefore, the administrator needs to assign the appropriate categories and values to the cluster
and the image to make them compatible with the placement policy. References: Nutanix Certified Professional

C. Creation of Calm Runbooks for each of the three steps &added to the library end consumed inside of
Post VM Delete Task.
D. Creation of Calm Endpoint that includes all steps added 35 a Post VM Delete Task
Answer: C

Explanation
Calm Runbooks are a way to automate workflows that span across multiple applications, services, or
platforms. They can be used to perform actions such as provisioning, scaling, backup, restore, etc. Calm
Runbooks can be added to the Library and reused in different Blueprints or Projects. A Post VM Delete Task
is a special type of Task that is executed after a VM is deleted from a Blueprint. By creating Calm Runbooks
for each of the manual steps required to decommission a VM, and adding them to the Library, the
administrator can simplify the VM Decommission Process by consuming them inside of a Post VM Delete
Task. This way, the application owners only need to delete the application from the Calm project, and the rest
of the steps will be automated by the Runbooks. References:

A. Configure a Protection Domain to replicate images.
B. Clone the images from the Cluster01 to Cluster02.
C. All images are available to all clusters managed by a single Prism Central.
D. Utilize Prism Central image placement policies.
Answer: A

Explanation
Protection Domains are a Nutanix feature that allows you to replicate data across clusters or to a remote site.
You can use Protection Domains to replicate images from one cluster to another, and then use them for
workload automation. This is one of the methods documented in the Nutanix Solutions Portal for Citrix MCS

Metric: Select CPU Usage (%) as the metric to monitor the VMs’ CPU utilization.
Condition: Select Less Than as the operator and enter 5 as the threshold value to define the idle state.
Duration: Enter 5 as the duration value and select Minutes as the unit to set the time period for the idle
state.
To create a Playbook with the alert as the trigger, the administrator needs to do the following steps:
Name: Enter a descriptive name for the Playbook, such as Idle VM Alert.
Trigger: Select Alert as the trigger type and choose the alert that was created for idle VMs.
Action: Select Email as the action type and enter the recipient email address, subject, and message for

In the context of Nutanix Multicloud Automation (NCP-MCA), the order of actions in a playbook is crucial
